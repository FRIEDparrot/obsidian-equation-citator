## 🚨 Disclaimer

This plugin can edit and update files in your Obsidian vault.

Although it has been thoroughly tested on multiple versions and used daily on my own vault for several months without data loss, unexpected bugs may still occur — especially when new features are introduced.

To protect your data, I strongly recommend enabling the “File Recovery” core plugin (or keeping regular backups) before using this plugin.

While I cannot take responsibility for data loss caused by bugs or unexpected behavior, I take reports seriously and will investigate and fix any critical issues that cause data loss as quickly as possible.

##  🐛 Bug & Reports 

If you encounter any bug, please **provide the following information** on the issue page : 
1.  A description of the bug or issue, along with steps to reproduce it.
2.  The relevant markdown text that triggers the issue.  
3.  Enable debug mode in the settings tab, and provide the console log (Ctrl + Shift + I in Obsidian). 

> [!TIP] 
> Since this plugin have cache mechanism for better performance, normal delay or no in-time update is a normal cache-related behavior. So you may wait several seconds, or re-open file or restart obsidian to ensure your issue is not just a normal cache-related behavior.
