**Complete Features & Updates** : see [Changelog](https://github.com/FRIEDparrot/obsidian-equation-citator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) 

**Video Tutorial**: I'll make a video tutorial if this plugin has 5000 downloads or this repo gets 50 stars.

## How to use this plugin? 

You can download following 3 files in the latest release page :
```sh
main.js
manifest.json
style.css
```
and put them in `.obsidian/plugins/equation-citator` folder under your obsidian vault.  

Also after this plugin is published in obsidian, you can download it from community plugins. 

## Introduction & Simple Examples
Obsidian-Equation-Citator is a plugin that provides a simple and elegant way to write in-line equation citation cite equations in obsidian just like `\ref{}` label in latex.

Here is a simple examples to show how it works.
```
$$ E = mc^2 \tag{A} $$

This is an equation $\ref{eq:A}$.
```

this will be rendered as follows (support both light and dark theme) :

- Why this plugin?
  - While the existing plugin [Math Booster](<https://www.obsidianstats.com/plugins/math-booster>) (or `LaTeX-like Theorem & Equation Referencer` now) also provides equation citation in obsidian (since it's based on latex, it can't do cross-file citation and outline-based equation autonumber). Equation citator is focused on providing an **easy-to-use, light-weight but more powerful, elegant, and full customizable citation experience**. 

- This plugin would be very helpful if you : 
  - have habit of adding `\tag{}` in equation blocks, and want to have a elegant and powerful way to cite them. 
  - don't want to add ugly block reference `^` in your equation blocks for reference, and make your citation more organized and clean. 

> [!warning] 
> You should follow some very simple rules to make this plugin work properly, 
> please check [Full Tutorial & Guidelines](https://github.com/FRIEDparrot/obsidian-equation-citator/blob/master/tutorials) for details.

> If an issue occurs because of you are not following such rules, such issue may be closed without being fixed. 

## Main Features
### 1.  üöÄ **Make citations, Preview, Easy jump and Rename Tags**

Use simple inline `$\ref{eq:A}$` format to cite equation block with `\tag{A}` and preview it just as links in obsidian.  

`Ctrl + hover` to preview the equation of following tag (just hover when in reading mode). `double click` to jump to location of equation, or `ctrl + double click` to open on the right and jump

**Select tag (`\tag{1.2}`) and right click to rename tag**, and its **citation will be automatically updated**.

### 2.  üîó**Cross-file citation, Multi/Consecutive citation**

- Cross-file citation is supported by **footnote format**. Citing several equations by delimiter `,` is also supported. 

- Use consecutive format (`~`) to cite multiple equations. 

```sh
# for example
$\ref{eq:1^1.3.1~3, 1^2.1.1~2}$
# but we recommend this nested format after version 1.2.2 : 
$\ref{eq:1^{1.3.1~3}, 1^{2.1.1~2}}$ 
```

### 3.  ‚úàÔ∏è **Auto complete citations** 

Suggest you available equations when adding citations and fill in the equation number in 1-click :

### 4. ‚ö°**One-click outline-based Equation AutoNumber**

**Auto number all the equations in by one click on the sidebar icon**  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-square-function-icon lucide-square-function"><rect width="18" height="18" x="3" y="3" rx="2" ry="2"/><path d="M9 17c2 0 2.8-1 2.8-2.8V10c0-2 1-3.3 3.2-3"/><path d="M9 11.2h5.7"/></svg>

### 5.  üìú**PDF export support** 

Original PDF export in obsidian can fail to render citation, so a command `Make markdown copy to export PDF` is provided to make markdown for export to pdf correctly.
